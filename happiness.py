st.markdown('The survey data gathered from respondents in various nations determines the countrys ladder score, or happiness rate, which is proportional to how happy we are in our daily lives. Based on a Cantril ladder poll, the national happiness rankings are shown. Respondents from nationally representative samples are asked to visualise a ladder, with a 10 representing their ideal life and a 0 representing their worst scenario. Then, using same 0â€“10 scale, they are asked to score their own current lifestyles. The GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make decisions, generosity, and sense of corruption are the six criteria that go into determining happiness.')

The direct economic loss was approximately 27,473,539,000 dollars. This was obviously a very destructive event that is very likely to have caused the happiness rate to decrease. However, the damage wasnt permanant, so the happiness rate bounced back the next few years (from what we see in the graph). In 2019, there were some events that contributed to nationalism and major acomplishments. First, it was China's 70th aniversary and there was a lot of celebrations and patriotism. China also finished building a brand new airport in beijing, the capital of the country, and Huawei developed 5G technology. Overall, there were a series of events that are benificial to the economy and natinalism. Then, obviously the downfall from 2020 to 2021 was because China, as well as every other country in the world went into lockdown due to covid-19.")
st.title('Conclusion')
st.markdown('In this case study, we looked at the world happiness dataset from 2005-2021, and made comparisons between countries, regions, and happiness variables. First, we found that the three variables most correlated to the ladder score (happiness) are social support, healthy life expectancy at birth, log GDP per capita, while the least correlated happiness factors are year, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. Furthermore, we studied the changes of happiness score in terms of both regions and countries, and found the top countries of each year, of which the region western europe dominated for many years. We also found that countries from the same region tend to have relatively similar ladder scores, and that there are rarely outliers. Lastly, we analyzed China specifically, and found explainations for some unexpected data.')
